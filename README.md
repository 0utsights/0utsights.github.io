# johnsurles.com — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Live Site

## Tech Stack

- **HTML** – page structure
- **CSS** – layout, typography, and layering
- **JavaScript (Canvas API)** – animated hex grid background
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting
- **Namecheap** – custom domain + DNS

No frameworks, no libraries.

### Key concepts used:
- Axial hex coordinates (based on Red Blob Games)
- Pointy-top hex geometry
- Seamless looping via modular wrapping
- Diagonal panning with time-based motion

The grid is not precomputed or tiled images — every hex is drawn mathematically each frame.

Reference used for the math:
